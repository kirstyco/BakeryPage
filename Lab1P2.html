Quality is our priority. Only the best ingredients go into our baked goods. 
We don't skimp on the good stuff - like pure vanilla extra, fresh fruit zest and juices, fresh eggs, top of the line cake flours the finest baking chocolates, and of course... lots and lots of butter!
While we are no longer offering walk-in business, we are happily accepting cake and cupcake orders that can be placed by phone or email. 
Orders placed will be available for delivery or for you to pick up at our pick up location!
We strive to make your experience with Kat's Cakes the most pleasurable one. 
While an event in need of a cake is a happy one, we understand the stress that goes into planning your event, and want to make your experience as enjoyable as possible!
